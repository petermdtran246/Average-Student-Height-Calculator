# Average Student Height Calculator

## Program Description:
This program calculates the average student height from a list of heights. It does this by iterating through the list, adding each height to a total, and keeping track of the number of students. Finally, it calculates the average height by dividing the total height by the number of students.

### Input:

A list of student heights (e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146])

### Output:
  -   Total height (sum of all student heights)
  -   Number of students (length of the input list)
  -   Average height (total height divided by number of students, rounded to the nearest whole number)

## Example Inputs and Outputs:

### Example Input 1: student_heights = [156, 178, 165, 171, 187]
### Output:
  -  Total height: 857
  -  Number of students: 5
  -  Average height: 171

### Example Input 2: student_heights = [151, 145, 179]
### Output:
  -  Total height: 475
  -  Number of students: 3
  -  Average height: 158
